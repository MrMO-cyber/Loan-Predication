Loan Default Prediction – Supervised Machine Learning
Project Overview

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer will default on a loan. Using historical financial and demographic data, the models learn patterns associated with credit risk to support accurate and responsible financial decision-making.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-level information along with a labeled target variable indicating loan repayment status.

Target Variable

default:

0 → No default

1 → Default

Input Features

Age

Income

Credit Score

Debt-to-Income Ratio

Number of Existing Accounts

Employment Length

Education Level

Past Delinquency History

These features provide insight into customer financial behavior, stability, and creditworthiness.

Tools & Environment

Platform: Google Colab

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

All data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation were performed in a Google Colab Notebook for efficiency and reproducibility.

Methodology

Data loading and exploration

Data preprocessing and feature preparation

Model training using supervised classification algorithms

Model evaluation and comparison

Analysis of feature importance and credit risk factors

Objective

Predict whether a customer will default on a loan

Identify the most influential features affecting credit risk

Results

The trained models demonstrate the ability to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk customers, helping financial institutions improve loan approval decisions and reduce default risk.
