📊 Loan Default Prediction

Supervised Machine Learning Classification Project

📌 Project Overview

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer will default on a loan based on historical financial and demographic data. The goal is to improve credit risk assessment and support responsible financial decision-making.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-level information along with a labeled target variable indicating loan repayment status.

🎯 Target Variable

default

0 → No Default

1 → Default

🧾 Input Features

Age

Income

Credit Score

Debt-to-Income Ratio
